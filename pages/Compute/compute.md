## What the community does

Mainly:
- We give guidance on Deployment Tools, Computing Environment and Monitoring Tools
- We facilitate hacks and seek 3rd party hacks to attend
- We identify gaps in products and services feedback to engineering
Also:
- We identify community-driven OSS projects to contribute to
- We share patterns, lessons learned and roadmaps
- We provide reference implementations (1st or 3rd party)
- We provide links to upskilling content
- We track what's going on at conferences
- We are one global community across all CSE teams
